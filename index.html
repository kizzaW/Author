                <p>I grew up in a mining community, in a family of six kids. We weren't well off. At aged 13, I met a lovely lad from an orphanage nearby, who wanted to live with my family. When I said he couldnâ€™t, he took his own life. I later learned that
                    he was being abused and was looking for help. This experience still affects me deeply and probably motivated me to do what I do now.
                    <br> After 30+ years in corporate life (NHS, Consultant Clinical Psychologist), I took early retirement and was one of the first 55year olds to draw down my final salary pension...and spent it. A reckless online comment about this
                    drew the attention of The Mail on Sunday, which covered my story.

                    Since then I've been working on many project's and stories, why not dig deeper and see what crazy writings I have to offer.<br> I'm reputed to have a <strong>'warped' </strong> sense of humour, which I attribute to too long spent sat
                    at the stern twiddling the tiller. I am an RYA Inland Waterways fully qualified helmsman. My husband is an RYA Inland Waterways Helmsman Instructor - so as you can imagine, between us we have a fair bit to say about the 'competencies'
                    or lack thereof, of many skippers!<br> We have a narrow boat hire company, so plenty to report about the weird and wonderful things our guests get up to.....I could do a whole series on what gets stuck in the macheter.... I'm heavily
                    involved with canal restoration in the Northwest, and I have a BIG project in hand, which I promise is going to make a BIG splash - endorsed by both the Cabinet Office and HRH Queen Elizabeth II. All I'll say at this time is she's
                    called 'Sovereign Lady'. Then there's the daft stuff I write - like my 'cruising with canines', my childrens books and Sally the Seagul and many more!
