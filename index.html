        <p>I grew up in a mining community, in a family of six kids. We weren't well off. At aged 13, I met a lovely lad from an orphanage nearby, who wanted to live with my family. When I said he couldn’t, he took his own life. I later learned that he was
            being abused and was looking for help. This experience still affects me deeply and probably motivated me to do what I do now.

            After 30+ years in corporate life (NHS, Consultant Clinical Psychologist), I took early retirement and was one of the first 55year olds to draw down my final salary pension...and spent it. A reckless online comment about this drew the attention of The
            Mail on Sunday, which covered my story. <br>Since then I've been working on many project's and stories, why not dig deeper and see what crazy writings I have to offer.<br> I'm reputed to have a <strong>'warped' </strong> sense
            of humour, which I attribute to too long spent sat at the stern twiddling the tiller. I am an RYA Inland Waterways fully qualified helmsman. My husband is an RYA Inland Waterways Helmsman Instructor - so as you can imagine, between us we have
            a fair bit to say about the 'competencies' or lack thereof, of many skippers!</p>

            We have a narrow boat hire company, so plenty to report about the weird and wonderful things our guests get up to.....I could do a whole series on what gets stuck in the macheter.... I'm heavily involved with canal restoration in the Northwest, and I
            have a BIG project in hand, which I promise is going to make a BIG splash - endorsed by both the Cabinet Office and HRH Queen Elizabeth II. All I'll say at this time is she's called 'Sovereign Lady'. Then there's the daft stuff I write - like
            my 'cruising with canines', my childrens books and Sally the Seagul and many more!

                <p class="popupText">…..from very early on I decided I wanted to be different to the other streetkids in our town. I made it my life’s mission to try to change not only my life, but also that of other youngsters forced to live on the streets. The reasons children
                    end up living alone are varied, but include such things as:- • orphans whose parents have died from the HIV pandemic • abandoned by families that could not afford to feed, clothe or educate them • some have fled their homes because
                    of abuse within the household • others have escaped from abusive work situations (it’s common in Uganda for children to be sent out to work to help feed their brothers sisters and extended families). The young man I’m going to tell
                    you about today was just 11 years old when I met him. I’ll call him Kal, which is a shortened version of his real name. I remember the occasion very vividly. It was 17th June 2014 at around midday….</p>
