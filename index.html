            <p>I grew up in a mining community, in a family of six kids. We weren't well off. At aged 13, I met a lovely lad from an orphanage nearby, who wanted to live with my family. When I said he couldn’t, he took his own life. I later learned that
                he was being abused and was looking for help. This experience still affects me deeply and probably motivated me to do what I do now.

                After 30+ years in corporate life (NHS, Consultant Clinical Psychologist), I took early retirement and was one of the first 55year olds to draw down my final salary pension...and spent it. A reckless online comment about this drew the attention of The
                Mail on Sunday, which covered my story. <br>Since then I've been working on many project's and stories, why not dig deeper and see what crazy writings I have to offer.<br> I'm reputed to have a <strong>'warped' </strong>                sense of humour, which I attribute to too long spent sat at the stern twiddling the tiller.

                    <h2>What Happens When Families Fail</h2>
                    <p> From very early on I decided I wanted to be different to the other streetkids in our town. I made it my life’s mission to try to change not only my life, but also that of other youngsters forced to live on the streets. The reasons
                        children end up living alone are varied, but include such things as:- • orphans whose parents have died from the HIV pandemic • abandoned by families that could not afford to feed, clothe or educate them • some have fled their
                        homes because of abuse within the household • others have escaped from abusive work situations (it’s common in Uganda for children to be sent out to work to help feed their brothers sisters and extended families). The young man
                        I’m going to tell you about today was just 11 years old when I met him. I’ll call him Kal, which is a shortened version of his real name. I remember the occasion very vividly. It was 17th June 2014 at around midday….

                <p> Sally lay on her bed listening to the sounds of Whitby waking up. She felt very safe and very comfortable. She thought back to just a few months ago, when she had lived a very different sort of life. Sally had been born in a hot country
                    called Spain, where the people were not kind to her. They had called her nasty names and made it very clear they did not want her to live near them. Then ‘Awww pet Amanda’ had become her friend. ‘Aww pet Amanda’ lived in a place called
                    Newcastle in England. She had told the Glamorous Grandma and Grumpy Grandad about Sally. ‘Aww pet Amanda’ had arranged for Sally to come to England, where the Glamorous Grandma and Grumpy Grandad also lived. They lived in a town called
                    Gainsborough and soon Sally was sharing their home with them. When she had lived in Spain, Sally had spent much of her time alone sitting under a tree. No-one wanted to be her friend. No-one wanted to love her. Now the Glamorous Grandma
                    and Grumpy Grandad loved her very much. She knew, because they kept telling her so. Sally really liked being loved and she really liked loving the Glamorous Grandma and Grumpy Grandad.

                    I was born in 1928 in Argentina, though have only a very vague recall of my early years. From what I’ve been told, my family were reasonably well-off. My father had owned many shops in several towns and areas of the country, but eventually - through no
                    fault of his own - he lost much of what he owned. His nephews borrowed heavily against his business in order to fund their own activities. Unlike my father, they were not successful at what they did. Their enterprises failed and accordingly,
                    my father paid a very high price by losing his businesses. Despite these difficulties, my father was still able to provide our family with a good standard of living. We had a nanny and a chauffeur, not to forget our dressmaker. She
                    made the most beautifully embroidered dresses for us. I still have pictures now of me and my sisters wearing some of the dresses. Our mother was very proud and insistent that we behave as young ladies, though my preference was to be
                    outdoors climbing trees and playing with my brother or the boy who lived across the road.

                    Back in the ‘good old days’, when kids were kids and life was so much easier (well, for some at least) there was a children’s counting game that everyone could play. It was a simple game of placing one person’s fist on top of another’s fist and counting
                    – ‘one potato, two potato, three potato, 4; five potato, six potato, seven potato, more’. I can’t remember how it ended, probably with the kids bashing each other I suspect! So what has that got to do with Community Interest Companies,
                    you might wonder? Well, later in this book I’ll be talking about one of the BIG problems I recently encountered in a CIC of which I was a Director. Without giving too much away at this time, it turned out a bit like the children’s
                    game of yore, except it was a game of changing Directors. Hence, One Director, Two Directors, Three Directors, 4….
