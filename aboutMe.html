            After 30+ years in corporate life (NHS, Consultant Clinical Psychologist), I took early retirement and was one of the first 55year olds to draw down my final salary pension...and spent it. A reckless online comment about this drew the attention of The
            Mail on Sunday, which covered my story. <br>Since then I've been working on many project's and stories, why not dig deeper and see what crazy writings I have to offer.<br> I'm reputed to have a <strong>'warped' </strong> sense
            of humour, which I attribute to too long spent sat at the stern twiddling the tiller. I am an RYA Inland Waterways fully qualified helmsman. My husband is an RYA Inland Waterways Helmsman Instructor - so as you can imagine, between us we have
            a fair bit to say about the 'competencies' or lack thereof, of many skippers!</p>

            We have a narrow boat hire company, so plenty to report about the weird and wonderful things our guests get up to.....I could do a whole series on what gets stuck in the macheter.... I'm heavily involved with canal restoration in the Northwest, and I
            have a BIG project in hand, which I promise is going to make a BIG splash - endorsed by both the Cabinet Office and HRH Queen Elizabeth II. All I'll say at this time is she's called 'Sovereign Lady'. Then there's the daft stuff I write - like
            my 'cruising with canines', my childrens books and Sally the Seagul and many more!
