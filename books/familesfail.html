            What is a Community Interest Company (CIC)? Back in the ‘good old days’, when kids were kids and life was so much easier (well, for some at least) there was a children’s counting game that everyone could play. It was a simple game of placing one person’s
            fist on top of another’s fist and counting – ‘one potato, two potato, three potato, 4; five potato, six potato, seven potato, more’. I can’t remember how it ended, probably with the kids bashing each other I suspect! So what has that got to
            do with Community Interest Companies, you might wonder? Well, later in this book I’ll be talking about one of the BIG problems I recently encountered in a CIC of which I was a Director. Without giving too much away at this time, it turned
            out a bit like the children’s game of yore, except it was a game of changing Directors. Hence, One Director, Two Directors, Three Directors, 4…. From - ‘One Director, Two Director, Three Director, Four… : How to set up a Community Interest
            Company avoiding some of the pitfalls along the way.” A business book aimed at those thinking of setting up a Community Interest Company (CIC) for the benefit of a defined cause or group.</p>
